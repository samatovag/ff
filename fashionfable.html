                    <strong>Tailoring</strong> is making a strong comeback. Structured blazers, high-waisted trousers, and well-fitted coats are great investments. They add polish and can be dressed up or down.

                    <strong>Minimalist elegance.</strong> For those who prefer a more understated look, minimalist fashion is still very much in vogue. Clean lines, monochromatic outfits, and simple, well-made pieces are always in style.
